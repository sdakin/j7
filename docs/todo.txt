implement scoring system
  x covering a cell: lower row:  15
					 middle row: 10
					 upper row:  25
  x triples: triples result in a bonus earned and the following bonus points:
  			 3, 6: 3x25=75
			 9, 12: 3x50=150
			 15, 18, 21: 3x100=300
  x opening 7's: an opening 7, 14 or 21 results in a bonus earned and a doubling value
				 that starts at 100 (100, 200, 400, ...).
  x opening triples: an opening triple doubles the standard triples points bonus and keeps
				 	 the opening bonus in effect. Opening 21's score both an opening
				 	 7's bonus and an opening triples bonus.
	up&down: bonus earned plus 25 points per column, left to right (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175), 
			 each higher column goes down 25 when a lower one is played.
	across:	 bonus earned plus 100 points per row, bottom to top (100, 200, 300),
			 each higher row goes down 100 when a lower one is played.
	13's: rolling a 13 at any time results in the loss of a bonus and a doubling penalty
		  that starts at 100. Opening 13 penalties are doubled (loss of two bonuses and
		  skip 1 in the doubling penalty sequence).
