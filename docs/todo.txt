implement scoring system
	covering a cell: lower row:  15
					 middle row: 10
					 upper row:  25
	opening 7's: an opening 7, 14 or 21 results in a bonus earned and a doubling value
				 that starts at 100 (100, 200, 400, ...). Opening triples are doubled and
				 keep the opening bonus in effect. For 21's both bonuses are applied.
	triples: 3, 6: 3x25=75
			 9, 12: 3x50=150
			 15, 18, 21: 3x100=300
	up&down: 25 per column, left to right (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175), 
			 each column goes down 25 when one is played
	across:	 100 per row, bottom to top (100, 200, 300),
			 each row goes down 100 when one is played
	13's: rolling a 13 at any time results in the loss of a bonus and a doubling penalty
		  that starts at 100. Opening 13 penalties are doubled (loss of two bonuses and
		  skip 1 in the doubling penalty sequence).
