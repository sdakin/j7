  x covering a cell: lower row:  15
					 middle row: 10
					 upper row:  25
  x triples: a triples spin earns a trick and the following bonus points:
  			 3, 6: 3x25=75
			 9, 12: 3x50=150
			 15, 18, 21: 3x100=300
  x opening 7's: an opening 7, 14 or 21 earns a trick and a doubling bonus
				 that starts at 100 (100, 200, 400, ...).
  x opening triples: an opening triple earns a trick, like a standard triples, but it doubles
  					 the standard triples points bonus and keeps the opening bonus in effect. 
  					 Opening 21's score both an opening 7's bonus and an opening triples bonus
  					 (2 tricks, plus the bonus points for each).
  x up&down: covering all 3 cells in a column earns a trick and 25 points per column, left to 
			 right (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175). The bonus points for a column are reduced 
			 by 25 points for each column to the left that has already scored an up&down bonus.
  x across:	 covering all 7 cells in a row earns a trick and 100 points per row, bottom to top
			 (100, 200, 300). The bonus points for a row are reduced by 100 points for each
			 row below that has already scored an across bonus.
  x unused bonuses: at the end of the game each unused bonus will score bonus points that start
  					at 25 and increase by 25 for each successive one (25, 50, 75, ...).
  x 13's: rolling a 13 at any time results in the loss of a bonus and a doubling penalty
		  that starts at 100. Opening 13 penalties are doubled (loss of two bonuses and
		  skip 1 in the doubling penalty sequence).

x clean up bonuses earned/used display (use popup like score details)
